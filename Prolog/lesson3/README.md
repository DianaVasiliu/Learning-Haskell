# Lesson 3

In this lesson, we will implement a syntax checker for the IMP language.

In the `imp.pl`, you can find the rules of the language.

Define the operators and write predicates to check arithmetic expressions, boolean expressions, statements and programs.

-   `aexp/1`
-   `bexp/1`
-   `stmt/1`
-   `program/2`
