# Learning Haskell

## Requirements

To start learning Haskell, there is some software that must be installed first.

1. a text editor - I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because it is very easy to use, to configure and is very customizable
2. [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) - a tool to help creating and developing Haskell projects
3. [Haskell](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell) extension (for VS Code) - for code highlighting, warning and error reporting and others
